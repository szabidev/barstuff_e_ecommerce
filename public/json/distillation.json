      "Title": "Introduction to Alcohol Distillation",
      "Description": "Alcohol distillation is a process used to separate ethanol from a fermented liquid, concentrating the alcohol and refining the product. This process involves heating the liquid to vaporize the alcohol, then cooling the vapor to condense it back into liquid form. Distillation is a key method in the production of spirits and various industrial applications. It allows for the extraction of alcohol from fermented beverages and the purification of ethanol for various uses."
