      "description": "Fermentation is a natural metabolic process that converts carbohydrates, such as sugars and starches, into alcohol or acids using microorganisms like yeast and bacteria. This biochemical process is integral to the production of a wide range of foods and beverages, including bread, beer, wine, yogurt, and kimchi. Fermentation can also be used to preserve foods and enhance their nutritional value. This process is typically anaerobic, meaning it occurs in the absence of oxygen, although some fermentation types may occur in the presence of oxygen."
